name: OWASP API Security Project
x-slug: owasp-api-security-project
description: This project is designed to address the ever-increasing number of organizations
  that are deploying potentially sensitive APIs as part of their software offerings.
  These APIs are used for internal tasks and to interface with third parties. Unfortunately,
  many APIs do not undergo the rigorous security testing that would render them secure
  from attack.
